mínima.\n","\n","La mayor mejora se dio en el Árbol de Decisión, fue clave la optimización, ya que subió mucho su accuracy con ajuste de profundidad.\n","\n","Los modelos más fuertes (KNN, Regresión Logística, LightGBM) tenían ya una base muy buena, por eso la optimización solo trajo pequeños cambios o incluso ligeras variaciones.\n","\n","El modelo de machine learning entrenado logró una alta precisión (alrededor del 97%) para distinguir entre personas introvertidas y extrovertidas a partir de características relacionadas con su comportamiento social (como tiempo pasado a solas, asistencia a eventos sociales, círculo de amigos, entre otros).\n","\n","Esto indica que las variables analizadas capturan efectivamente las diferencias en hábitos y patrones sociales que caracterizan a cada tipo de personalidad."],"metadata":{"id":"-_wQGi73pD81"}}]}
